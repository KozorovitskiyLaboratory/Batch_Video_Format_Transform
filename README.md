# Batch Video Format Changing
A python program that can transform all video files in a folder into a common format supported by ffmpeg

<h4>Before you use:</h4>
<p>•	Install ffmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/), a free command line tool to transform different video type files, including h264, avi, mp4, etc.</p>
<p>•	Install ffmpy, a python wrapper for ffmpeg. (https://ffmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</p>
<p>•	I use Jupyter Notebook but other python IDE should also work if you have correctly installed the said packages.</p>
